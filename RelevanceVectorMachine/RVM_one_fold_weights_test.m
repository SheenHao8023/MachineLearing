function [perf,ypred_val,y_val,weights] = RVM_one_fold_weights_test(x, y, cv_ind, fold, confounds, CovCateIdx)
% 
% This function runs RVM for one cross-validation fold. The
% relationship between features and targets is assumed to be 
% y = x * weights + b.

% INPUT:
%       - x       : NxF matrix containing F features from N subjects
%       - y       : Nx1 matrix containing the target values from N subjects
%       - cv_ind  : Nx1 matrix containing cross-validation fold assignment
%                   for N subjects. Values should range from 1 to 10 for a
%                   10-fold cross-validation                
%       - fold    : Fold to be used as validation set   
%       - confounds: NxD matrix containing D confounds for N subjects.

% OUTPUT:
%       - r_val  :Pearson correlation between predicted target values and
%                 actual target values in validation set              
%       - weights:Fx1 matrix containing weights of the F features
